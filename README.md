Tiled-maps-and-SVG-effects
==========================

Dynamic tile clipping and other SVG effects for interactive maps.
Demo made with [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) plugin for showing some useful abilities of SVG effects.
You can add and edit polygons for clipping or masking (with patterns) overlay. You also can apply different SVG filters for overlay. Polygons can be filled with patterns for masking and you can blur edges of clipped areas.
